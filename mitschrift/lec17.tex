\tocsection{Complexity Theory (Komplexitätstheorie)}

A \new{problem}{Problem} is a general question, where several parameters are left open. A \new{solution}{Lösung} consists of answers for those parameters. A problem is defined by a description of all its parameters and which properties require an answer. A \new{problem instance}{Probleminstanz} is a specific input where all known parameters are explicitly given. 

The question "What is the shortest travelling salesman tour in a graph?" is a \emph{problem}, whereas the question "What is the shortest travelling salesman tour in bier127.tsp?" is a \emph{problem instance} of the earlier problem. The known parameters are the number of cities and the distance matrix. The parameters left open are the follow-up city for every city.

In general, we denote a problem as $\Pi$, whereas an instace of problem $\Pi$ is denoted by $I \in \Pi$.

An \new{algorithm}{Algorithmus} \emph{solves} a problem $\Pi$ if for every problem instance $I \in \Pi$, the algorithm finds a solution. The aim of designing algorithms is to develop procedures to fnd a solution for any problem instance that is as \emph{"efficient"} as possible, in particular efficient regarding \emph{time} and \emph{memory} requirements.

There exist two types of problems: problems that can be answered by "yes" or "no" and those that ask to find an object with certain properties.
"Does there exist a solution to the TSP with the value at most $K$?" can be answered by "yes" or "no". Of course, the answer "yes" should be verifiable with a tour of length $\leq K$; an answer "no" should also be guaranteed.

For yes/no problems, we do not have to distinguish between \emph{solution} and \emph{optimal solution}.

The \new{time complexity}{Zeitkomplexität} (respectively the \new{memory complexity}{Speicherkomplexität}) of an algorithm depends in general on the \emph{"size"} of the problem instance, for example the \emph{amount} of input data.

The \emph{encoding} of a problem instance is of critical importance. Integers are \emph{binary encoded}. The binary encoding of nonnegative integer $n$ requires $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ bits. One more bit is required for the sign of an integer. The \new{coding length}{Codierungslänge} $<n>$ is the number of bits required to encode $n$.
\[
	<n>:=\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil + 1
\]
A rational number $r = \frac pq$ has coding length $<r> := <p> + <q>$.
The coding length of a vector $x \in \Q^n$ is $<x>:= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n<x_i> \leq n \cdot \max<  x_i >$ and of a matrix $A \in \Q^{n \times n}$ is $<A> := \sum\limits_{i=1}^m\sum\limits_{j=1}^n<a_{ij}> \leq m \cdot n \cdot\max< a_{ij} >$.

Data structures to encode graphs and digraphs will be discussed in the next lecture.

The total number of bits required to describe a problem instance is called the \emph{coding length} or \new{input length}{Eingabelänge} $<I>$ of $I$.

\begin{xmp+}
	The Knapsack problem has input length \[
		<I> = <c> + <a> + <b> = 2 \cdot n \cdot \max<c_i, a_i> + <b>
	\]
\end{xmp+}

To execute an algorithm and to compute its running time and memory requirement depending on the input length of a problem instance, we need a so-called \emph{computing model}: a \emph{Turing-machine} or \emph{RAM-machine} are two examples (see exercise sheet).
	
The algorithm first reads the data of a problem instance and uses for this $<I>$ bits. Further bits are required to compute the solution. The \new{memory requirement}{Speicherbedarf} of algorithm $A$ to solve $I$ is the number of bits that are used at least once during the execution of $A$.

\begin{xmp+}
	Knapsac dynamic programming \[
		f(k,b) = \max \plainset{f(k-1,b), f(k-1, b-a_k) + c_k}
	\]. Only $2 \cdot b$ numbers hare to be kept for the computations.
\end{xmp+}

The \new{running time}{Laufzeit} of $A$ to solve $I$ is the number of elementary operations which $A$ requires until the end of the procedure. \new{Elementary operations}{elementare Operationen} are
\begin{itemize}
	\item reading, writing, and deleting
	\item adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing and comparing
\end{itemize}
of rational (integer) numbers. Here, we estimate each operation with respect to the maximum numbers involved.

The function $f_A:\N\rightarrow\N$ defined by
\[
	f_A(n) := \max_{I \in \Pi \text{ with } <I> \leq n} \plainset{\text{running time of $A$ to solve $I$}}
\] is called the \new{running time function}{Laufzeitfunktion} of $A$.

The function $S_A:\N\rightarrow\N$ defined by
\[
	f_A(n) := \max_{I \in \Pi \text{ with } <I> \leq n} \plainset{\text{memory requirement of $A$ to solve $I$}}
\] is called the \new{memory function}{Speicherbedarfsfunktion} of $A$.

\begin{xmp+}
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
	\emph{Examples:} & Knapsack DP & TSP DP \\
	\hline
	Inputlength & $(2n+1)<b>$ & $<n>+n^2 max<c_{ij}$ \\
	Runningtime & $\mathcal{O} (n\cdot b)$ & $2^{n-2}(n-1)-(n-2)$ \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{xmp+}

The algorithm A has \new{polynomial running time}{polynomielle Laufzeit} (short: A is a polynomial algorithm if there exists a polynomial $p:\N \rightarrow \N $ with $f_A(n) \leq p(n) \: \forall \: n \in \N.$ If $p$ is a polynomial of degree $k$, we call $f_A$ of order $n^k$ and write $f_A= O(n^k)$. Algorithm A has polynomial memory requirements if there exists a polynomial $q:\N \rightarrow \N$ such that $s_A(n) \leq q(n) \: \forall \: n \in \N$.

\emph{Example} Given a sequence of number $ a_i\in \N, \dots, a_k \in \N$, determine the largest value
Algorithm:
\begin{lstlisting}
max:=0
FOR i=1 TO $k$ DO
	IF $a_i >$ max THEN max:=$a_i$
\end{lstlisting}
Inputlength: $k \cdot max<a_j> \leq n$

Running time: $f_A(n)=\frac n {max<a_i>} \leq n$
				polynomial $p(n)=5n+1 $
				
Memory: $s_A(n)=2 max<a_i> \leq n$
